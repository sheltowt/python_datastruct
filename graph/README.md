Vertex
a vertex is the most basic part of a graph and it is called a node, a vertex may also have additional information and well call it a payload

Edge
an edge is another connects two vertices/Edges edges may be one-way or two-way.  If the edges in a graph are all one way it is a directed graph

Weight 
edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost to go from one vertex to another.  In a graph that connects one city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance between two cities
